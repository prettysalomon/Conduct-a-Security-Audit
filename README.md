<h1>Conduct a Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

 This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

My task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

<h2>Project Description</h2>

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive internal IT audit for Botium Toys. As the company ventures into international markets and processes online payments, the IT department faces increasing challenges in securing critical assets and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.

The audit aims to assess the organization's current cybersecurity posture by utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to identify potential risks, vulnerabilities, and threats to their IT infrastructure. The project will involve reviewing the IT manager’s defined audit scope, objectives, and risk assessment findings to establish a clear understanding of the company's security gaps.

A detailed controls and compliance checklist will be completed to evaluate the company’s adherence to regulatory requirements, including payment processing standards (PCI-DSS) and E.U. data protection regulations (GDPR). The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate security risks, ensure regulatory compliance, and support the company's sustainable growth in the global market.
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
Multiple controls need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, separation of duties, an IDS, ongoing legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system.

To address gaps in compliance, Botium Toys needs to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
